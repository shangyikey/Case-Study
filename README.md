# Case-Study

Hello Github,

I'm just trying to make some changes here and see what will happen.

I feel that I have a lot things to learn: English, coding, derivitives and math. I also want to pass the FRM and CFA exam and perform well for my job. Feel stressed but I believe myself. 

Also I want to keep fit and build my body.

Everything will go through if plans are made and hardwork paid. I believe that.

At here, hope I can play well and learn well!
